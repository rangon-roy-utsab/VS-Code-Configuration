# VS-Code-Configuration
*Hello!*
In order use these settings, you need to modify some line following the following steps: 
1. Create a new folder named *.vscode* in the folder where you save your codes.
2. Now place the files in that folder.
3. Replace the path of *my* complier with the path of *your* compiler. For example: Suppose your compiler *g++.exe* in located in *C:\Program Files\MinGW\bin*. Then  replace *C:\\Programs\\msys2-mingw64-9\\bin\\gdb.exe* with *C:\\Program Files\\MinGW\\bin*
4. Replace the paths of the input and output files.
5. Additionally you also might need to change the path of the debugger.
6. Run the code with *Ctrl+Alt+B*.
>You won't have to follow step 3 if you install *msys2-mingw64-9* through [pBox](http://pbox.me/packages/msys2-mingw64-9).

### *Happy Coding*
